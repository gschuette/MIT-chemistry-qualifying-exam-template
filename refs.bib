	abstract = {Unlike areas such as computer vision and speech recognition where convolutional and recurrent neural networks-based approaches have proven effective to the nature of the respective areas of application, deep learning (DL) still lacks a general approach suitable for the unique nature and challenges of RF systems such as radar, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and communications. Existing approaches face problems in robustness, consistency, efficiency, repeatability and scalability. One of the main challenges in RF sensing such as radar target identification is the difficulty and cost of obtaining data. Hundreds to thousands of samples per class are typically used when training for classifying signals into 2 to 12 classes with reported accuracy ranging from 87\% to 99\%, where accuracy generally decreases with more classes added. In this paper, we present a new DL approach based on multistage training and demonstrate it on RF sensing signal classification. We consistently achieve over 99\% accuracy for up to 17 diverse classes using only 11 samples per class for training, yielding up to 35\% improvement in accuracy over standard DL approaches.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments have revealed many structural features of chromatin across multiple length scales. Further understanding genome organization requires relating these discoveries to the mechanisms that establish chromatin structures and reconstructing these structures in three dimensions, but both objectives are difficult to achieve with existing algorithms that are often computationally expensive. To alleviate this challenge, we present an algorithm that efficiently converts Hi-C data into contact energies, which measure the interaction strength between genomic loci brought into proximity. Contact energies are local quantities unaffected by the topological constraints that correlate Hi-C contact probabilities. Thus, extracting contact energies from Hi-C contact probabilities distills the biologically unique information contained in the data. We show that contact energies reveal the location of chromatin loop anchors, support a phase separation mechanism for genome compartmentalization, and parameterize polymer simulations that predict three-dimensional chromatin structures. Therefore, we anticipate that contact energy extraction will unleash the full potential of Hi-C data and that our inversion algorithm will facilitate the widespread adoption of contact energy analysis.},

	abstract = {Genomic regions adopt heritable epigenetic states with unique histone modifications, resulting in bistable gene expression without changes to the underlying DNA sequence. The significance of chromatin conformational dynamics to epigenetic stability is not well understood. We introduce a kinetic model to simulate the dynamic fluctuation of histone modifications. The model explicitly incorporates the impact of chemical modifications on chromatin stability as well as the contribution of chromatin contacts to the cooperativity of chemical reactions. Leveraging the model’s computational efficiency, we study the disparate time scales of chromatin relaxation and epigenetic spread to account for the recent discovery of both liquid and gel-like properties of chromatin. Strikingly different results were obtained for the steady state and kinetic behavior of histone modification patterns in fast and slow chromatin structural relaxation regimes. Our study suggests that the timescale of chromatin conformational dynamics maybe an important axis that biology fine tunes to regulate epigenetic stability.},

	url = {https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7h78z1m1},
	abstract = {This thesis aims to improve on the current classification capabilities of deep neural networks on two types of radio-frequency data: radar and OFDM packets. In radar, applying neu- ral networks to Automatic Target Recognition problems is a well-developed field, especially using the MSTAR database. However, existing state-of-the-art methods require precise pre- conditioning of radar data and are unsuited to applications with a large number of radar target classes. Therefore, we asked whether distributed learning can increase the generaliz- ability and scalability of neural networks in these tasks. To test this, we applied distributed learning via Multi-Stage Training and a new network architecture, the Convolutional Multi- Stage Network, to provide a scalable, generalized treatment of radar data for more practical applications. This method was shown to outperform traditional neural network architectures on a new radar dataset. A similar approach was applied to the OFDM data with the goal of identifying specific radio-frequency transmitters for network security purposes. The task of identifying OFDM packet transmitters has previously been performed successfully, though with precise data collection methods. Data collection methods on a live network will likely include imperfect recording times, so we sought to improve network robustness to time- shifted OFDM packets. It was shown that the Convolutional Multi-Stage Network improved robustness to time-shifting of the radio-frequency data over the Multi-Stage Network, which was the previous-best method. Simple preconditioning of the data using variations of the dis- crete wavelet transform further improved robustness to time-shifting of the radio-frequency data using both network architectures. These results are significant, as they provide a new avenue for applying neural networks to radio-frequency in difficult, real-world applications.},

            Various cell types emerge from their nearly identical genetic content for a multicellular organism, in part, via the regulation of the function of the genome—the DNA molecules inside the cell. Similar to the way catalytic activity is lost when proteins denature, the function of the genome is tightly coupled to its 3D organization. A theoretical framework for picturing the structure and dynamics of the genome will therefore greatly advance our understanding of cell biology. We present an energy landscape model of the chromosome that reproduces a diverse set of experimental measurements. The model enables quantitative predictions of chromosome structure and topology and provides mechanistic insight into the role of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and cell differentiation.
          , 
            Chromosome conformation capture experiments provide a rich set of data concerning the spatial organization of the genome. We use these data along with a maximum entropy approach to derive a least-biased effective energy landscape for the chromosome. Simulations of the ensemble of chromosome conformations based on the resulting information theoretic landscape not only accurately reproduce experimental contact probabilities, but also provide a picture of chromosome dynamics and topology. The topology of the simulated chromosomes is probed by computing the distribution of their knot invariants. The simulated chromosome structures are largely free of knots. Topologically associating domains are shown to be crucial for establishing these knotless structures. The simulated chromosome conformations exhibit a tendency to form fibril-like structures like those observed via light microscopy. The topologically associating domains of the interphase chromosome exhibit multistability with varying liquid crystalline ordering that may allow discrete unfolding events and the landscape is locally funneled toward “ideal” chromosome structures that represent hierarchical fibrils of fibrils.},
